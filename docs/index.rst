PolColMC documentation
======================


This program was made for Monte-Carlo simulations of polydisperse spheres,
interacting with a hard-core Yukawa potential.
It computes energy, pressure, radial distribution
functions, effective structure factor, among other quantities.
The statistical ensembles can be: NVT, NPT or Gibbs.
